## Caching 

**Cache**: A piece of hardware or software that stores data, typically meant to retrieve that data faster than otherwise.

Caches are often used to store responses to networks requests as well as restuls of computationally-long operations. Note that Cache can be come **stale** if the main source of that data gets update and the cache does not. 



**Example**:

Client -> Server -> Database 

**Client** makes a call to the server, and then the server makes a request to the server. Then at client level, you can cache it.

If the **server** does some complicate algorithms, then you can cache that algorithm results at server level

**Database**: avoid similar calls.



**Example**: 

1. Algoexpert cache the question on the client. The user's request gets cached on the website. 

2. Running their code is also cached. (How do you cache a running code) (http request to algoexpert, hash the request to bit to a server level, (as a key) in memory database and return to the client)

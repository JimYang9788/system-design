### Goal 
* Collaborate 
* Resolve ambiguity constructively 

### 4-step 
Step 1 - Understand the problem and estabilish blueprint (10 mins)
* What specific features are we going to build? 
* How many users does the product have? 
* How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months and a year? 
* What is the tech stack? What existing service can be leveraged? 

Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in (reach an agreement) (10-15 mins)
* Come up with an intial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback.  Treat your interviewer as a teammate and work together. Many good interviewers love to talk and get invovled.
* Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper. This might include clients (mobile/web), APIs, web servers, data stores, cache , CDN, message queue, etc. 
* Back-of-the-envelope calculations 

Step 3 - Deep Dive (10-25mins)
* You can also go through some concret use cases 
* Also, consider going through an API endpoints design schema 

Step 4 - Wrap ups (3 - 5 mins)
* Error cases 
* Operation issues; how to monitor metrics
* how to handle the next scale curve
